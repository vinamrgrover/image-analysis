You need to return the specific properties of the image:
- description : Short description of the image
- objects : All the detected objects in the image
- colors : All the colors used in the image

The output should be a structured JSON:

```
{
    "description" : "string",
    "objects" : ["string"],
    "colors" : ["string"]
}
```
